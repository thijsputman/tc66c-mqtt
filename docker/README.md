## Building the Container

To locally build the container:

```bash
docker build -t tc66c-mqtt .
```

## Docker and Bluetooth

Using Bluetooth from inside a Docker container is not totally straightforward...

Roughly speaking there are two solutions:

1. Disable `bluetoothd` on the host and run it inside a priviliged container
   &mdash; effectively confining the use of Bluetooth to that one container
2. Communicate with Bluetooth via the host's D-BUS &mdash; all of the Bluetooth
   configuration has to happen outside of the container

Neither solution is optimal: There first one effectively bars the rest of the
system (i.e. everything not running in the "Bluetooth" container from using
Bluetooth). The second requires most of the Bluetooth configuration to happen on
the host (somewhat hampering "plug and play").

The second solution is nonetheless much preferred as it is non-invasive and
keeps Bluetooth available to other processes on the host.

Also, playing with the first solution on my Raspberry Pi 4 (i.e. repeatedly
switching Bluetooth between host and container) at some point causes the Pi4
UART Bluetooth modem to crash _hard_, only recoverable by rebooting the
system...

**N.B.** For convenience, the below examples use a Debian-based Node-container;
the final container used by the repository is based on Alpine. This might cause
some issues with the contents of `üìÅ node_modules` not being portable between
the two distros...

### Running `bluetoothd` _inside_ the Container

Again: Not the preferred solution, the information is just here for future
reference.

```bash
docker run --net=host --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN --cap-add=NET_ADMIN -it \
   -v $PWD:/var/tc66c-mqtt node:12-buster /bin/bash
```

Both `--cap-add` are required; alternatively use `--privileged` (which gives
even broader privileges to the container...).

On the host:

```bash
sudo service stop bluetooth
```

Inside the container:

```bash
apt update
apt install bluetooth
service dbus start
service bluetooth start
```

Ensure both `dbus-daemon` and `bluetoothd` are running before you continue. Then
add `/etc/dbus-1/system.d/node-ble.conf` (as described in the instructions for
[`node-ble`](https://github.com/chrvadala/node-bl); note that `%userid%` should
be **root**).

Execute the commands as you would normally do.

### Using D-Bus

Courtesy of: https://github.com/edgexfoundry-holding/device-bluetooth-c/pull/15.

I've compared the above AppArmor policy against the current
[Docker base AppArmor policy](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/apparmor/)
(which is
[somewhat cumbersome](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/contrib/apparmor/template.go)
as there's [no way yet](https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/39923) to actually see
the active policy).

Further modified the policy to include the additional D-Bus interfaces required
by [`node-ble`](https://github.com/chrvadala/node-bl) (based on the contents of
`üìÑ node-ble.conf`). I still intend to go through
https://gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor/-/wikis/AppArmorDBus and further
refine/confine the policy as I think it affords too much access at the moment...

Still, for now it works:

Add the AppArmor policy (needs to be done after each reboot):

```bash
sudo apparmor_parser -r -W ./docker/docker-ble
```

Then:

```shell
docker run \
  -v /var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket:/var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket \
  --security-opt apparmor=docker-ble -it -v $PWD:/tc66c-mqtt \
  node:12-buster /bin/bash
```

And simply execute the command as you would normally do.
