# ToDo

- Consider using a separate builder container to further reduce the size of the
  final image? It appears (based on the size of the resulting compressed layers)
  `apk add --virtual` leaves some residuals around...
- Refine the custom AppArmor-policy (see
  [`ðŸ“„ docker/README.md`](./docker/README.md#using-d-bus))
