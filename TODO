# ToDo

- Refine the custom AppArmor-policy (see
  [`ðŸ“„ docker/README.md`](./docker/README.md#using-d-bus))
- Don't add user/group in `ðŸ“„ 10-useradd` if they already exist
- Add a device identifier to the `tc66c/` MQTT topic; this allows measurements
  for multiple devices to be handled
- Properly manage failures; right now we gracefully shutdown the container
  (regardless of the script's exit code)
  - Build some retry logic into the s6-overlay scripts? Or find a way to
    "escalate" the problem out of the container?
