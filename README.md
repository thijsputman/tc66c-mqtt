# TC66C â€“ MQTT Bridge

A simple TC66C to MQTT bridge I'm using to keep track of my Raspberry Pi4's
electrical load in
[Home Assistant](https://github.com/thijsputman/home-assistant-config).
Simultaneously, a playground for me to get more familiar with some advanced
Docker/container concepts and to dust off my Node.js knowledge.

It publishes measurements of voltage, current and power to the `tc66c` topic at
a configurable interval.

- [3. References](#3-references)

## 1. Prerequisites

The TC66C is a USB-C load meter that communicates its measurements over
Bluetooth Low Energy â€“
[you'll need one of them](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32968303350.html) to
be able to retrieve load measurements...

The code most likely works on any Linux-system with BlueZ properly configured.
The only tested/supported configuration is the following though:

1. Raspberry Pi 4 Model B
2. Ubuntu 20.04 or 20.10 (`aarch64`)
3. Working Bluetooth-stack (i.e. ensure you `apt install pi-bluetooth` and
   reboot)

## 2. Usage

1. `npm install`
2. Follow the [`node-ble`](https://github.com/chrvadala/node-ble) instructions
   to properly configure D-Bus
3. `./index.js ble-address mqtt-broker [--interval ms] [--logLevel level]`

The default `--interval` at which measurements are fetched and returned is 2,000
ms. Use `--interval 0` to disable the interval and fetch measurements as fast as
possible (on my RPi4 this maxes out at around 700 ms per measurement).

The default `--logLevel` is `info`. You can optionally change it into `debug` to
get (a lot) more output, or to `warn` or `error` to get virtually no feedback.

### 2.1. Docker

Alternatively, you can use
[the pre-built Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/thijsputman/tc66c-mqtt).
Note that the Docker image currently is only available for **`aarch64`**!

In this case, there's no need to `npm install` nor to configure D-Bus.

For things to work in Docker, you _do_ need to load a custom AppArmor-policy
prior to starting the container:

```shell
sudo apparmor_parser -r -W ./docker/docker-ble
```

The AppArmor-policy needs to be reloaded after each system boot. There are many
ways to automate this, one would be:

```shell
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apparmor.d/containers && sudo cp ./docker/docker-ble "$_"
sudo crontab -e
# Insert the following into the crontab:
@reboot  /usr/sbin/apparmor_parser -r -W /etc/apparmor.d/containers/docker-ble
```

Once you've loaded the AppArmor-policy, the easiest way to get it up and running
is via `docker-compose up [-d]`:

`ðŸ“„ docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
version: "3.7"
services:
  tc66c-mqtt:
    image: thijsputman/tc66c-mqtt:latest
    security_opt:
      - apparmor=docker-ble
    volumes:
      - /var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket:/var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket
    environment:
      - TC66C_BLE_MAC=
      - MQTT_BROKER=
      - M_INTERVAL=
      - LOG_LEVEL=
      - PUID=
      - PGID=
```

Fill out `TC66C_BLE_MAC` (your TC66C's MAC address) and `MQTT_BROKER` (hostname
or IP address of your MQTT broker). You can optionally specify `M_INTERVAL` as
the measurement interval (in milliseconds) â€“ leaving it empty will use the
default interval of 2,000 ms. You can optionally specify `LOG_LEVEL` as one of
the following: `debug`, `info` (default), `warn` or `error`.

The `PUID` and `PGID` variables are optional. Specify them to have the script
run under a user other than `root`.

See [`ðŸ“„ docker/README.md`](./docker/README.md) for all the ins and outs with
regards to using Bluetooth (Low Energy) in a Docker container.

### 2.2. Subscribe to the MQTT Topic

Run the following command in another shell (or on another machine) to subscribe
to the `tc66c/#` topic (using [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/)) and validate
the messages are sent out properly.

```shell
mosquitto_sub -h <mqtt-broker> -t "tc66c/#"
```
